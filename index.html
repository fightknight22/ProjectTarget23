            <h2>Hi, I’m Dibyasankha Bhattacharyya</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a Computer Science student at Aston University, Birmingham, UK. ProjectTarget23 is my personal journey to create 20+ innovative, 
                non-monetized apps as part of my educational exploration. These projects focus on learning, experimentation, and solving real-world challenges.

            <h2>Why ProjectTarget23?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learning & Experimentation:</strong> Enhancing my technical skills and hands-on experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Monetized:</strong> All apps are free and strictly non-commercial.</li>
                <li><strong>Bring Your Own API Key Model:</strong> Users have to bring their own API key after they hit a limit for apps which use 3rd party APIs like OpenAI, BlueWillow, etc., since the apps are non-monetized and part of my educational journey and I can't afford to pay API charges.</li>
            </ul>

                Each app in ProjectTarget23 is built with a focus on usability, creativity, and solving practical problems. 
                They are designed to be scalable, future-ready, and showcase my technical growth.
